## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

```

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
*Syntax (Single Row):*
sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);

*Syntax (Multiple Rows):*
sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);

*Syntax (Insert from another table):*
sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;

### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;

### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
*Syntax (All rows):*
sql
DELETE FROM table_name;

*Syntax (Specific condition):*
sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
*Syntax:*
sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
